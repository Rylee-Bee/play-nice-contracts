# Plain Language

## In short

Say what happened, then what to do next, in words a person would use.
Keep every human-facing sentence the shortest one that stays accurate.
For unfamiliar ideas, give the reader something familiar to think with
without replacing the literal truth. A character may have a voice; hiding
the truth may not.

## Applies when

Anything meant for a person to read: screen text, messages, errors, button
labels, docs, reports. Not this contract's job: machine shapes (see
one-truth-two-views) or when to interrupt someone (see the floor, rule 15).

## Rules

1. Say what a thing does in a person's words: "Backups", not
   "cron-runner-v2". Provider names are history, not navigation. (MUST)
2. Every message has two parts, in order: what happened, then the next
   step. Never "Something went wrong." (MUST)
3. Name destructive actions by verb and consequence: "Delete these 3
   snapshots — permanent". Never a vague OK / Yes / Proceed. (MUST)
4. Pick the shortest wording that stays accurate: familiar words, easy to
   scan, easy to remember. Don't add words to sound formal or technical.
   (MUST)
5. Before calling human-facing text finished, cut repeated explanations,
   throat-clearing openings, and paragraphs that could be one sentence.
   Keep what correctness, safety, or operation needs. (MUST)
6. Truth before tone: never make the system sound more certain or capable
   than the evidence says (see the floor, rule 1), and don't polish wording
   over broken behaviour — record the product problem instead. (MUST)
7. Shape the reading: short sentences, lists and tables over prose walls,
   no ALL-CAPS headings. (SHOULD)
8. No manufactured urgency: no guilt, countdowns, streaks, or "don't
   leave!" patterns. (MUST)
9. Empty states are honest and helpful: "No journal entries yet", not fake
   data or a blank mystery. Say in words when something is not set up,
   unreachable, or broken. (MUST)
10. Humor and voice are welcome where they help someone understand —
    characters may have a voice — but never carry operational meaning or
    mask uncertainty. (SHOULD)
11. Keep machine identifiers stable behind the human wording, so the words
    can improve without breaking anything (see one-truth-two-views).
    (MUST)
12. For an important unfamiliar concept, give a concrete everyday way in.
    Use an analogy when it makes the useful relationships easier to
    understand, but never let the analogy contradict or replace the literal
    explanation. If the analogy would mislead, do not use it. (SHOULD)

## Examples

- Good: "Couldn't reach the backup service. Last good backup: yesterday
  23:00. [Retry] [View service]"
- Good: "Certificate expires in 2 days. Renewal is automatic; no action
  needed."
- Good teaching: "A work queue is like a line at a counter: items wait for
  their turn." Then keep the real term, "work queue", visible and explain
  retries or parallel workers when those details matter.
- Bad: "Are you sure?" on both reset and delete; "Error 500 occurred.";
  "OOPS! The elves spilled your data." as the only explanation.
- Bad teaching: an analogy that is easier to remember than the real rule but
  gives the reader the wrong idea about ownership, authority, safety, or
  failure.

## Why

Every ambiguous button becomes a support ticket, and every vague error
becomes an investigation. Plain, honest, short words are the cheapest way
to respect the reader's attention. A good analogy gives a newcomer a familiar
structure to attach new knowledge to; the literal explanation keeps that
shortcut honest.

## You're done when

- A newcomer can act on every message without asking anyone.
- An important unfamiliar concept has a concrete way in, and any analogy used
  for it preserves the useful relationship without becoming the source of
  truth.
- Every destructive control names verb and consequence on its label.
- No copy invents urgency, data, or confidence the system doesn't have.
- Each message survived one shortening pass without losing accuracy.
