## Status and provenance

**Historical collaboration story / non-normative lessons.** Recorded by OpenAI
Codex on 2026-09-12 at Rylee's request, from the conversation *Research Figma
Implementation Workflow* and Rylee's explicit Workshop v3 preservation brief.
This is Play-Nice's durable home for this story; the README routes here.

Rylee supplied the intent, corrections, provenance and acceptance context. The
Figma Workshop participant explored and converged the visual language; the
ChatGPT conversation helped articulate the principles and implementation
boundary. This account preserves their contributions without claiming that this
documentation session performed their design work or independently repeated
the Figma audit.

The frame inventory and audit verdicts below are **reported design-stage
evidence from that conversation**, not current runtime verification. The final
audit document's location was absent from the retrieved text; no frame IDs,
artifact paths or fresh visual inspection are invented here. The story is
self-contained so future participants need not access the private conversation.

This is not a new universal contract or a replacement Project Worlds spec.
[Canonical Play-Nice contracts](../../CONTRACT_INDEX.md) govern; Project Worlds'
repository owns its product truth. Its Mermaid, visitors and visual language
are a particular world's history, not required decoration for every adopter.

## From a wish to a language

The Workshop began with a modest wish: keep the capable product, but make it a
little more whimsical and less work-y. Sixteen warmth explorations carried that
question across arrival, ordinary work, uncertainty, attention, conversation
and private writing. The useful discovery was that each context wanted a
different amount of presence.

An arrival could be generous. A working screen could give space. A question
could be curious. Writing could make almost the whole interface withdraw.
Instead of spreading a fixed amount of charm over every screen, the Workshop
found a principle that could explain all of them:

> **The world knows how loudly to exist.**
>
> **The world doesn't shout.**
>
> **Project Worlds is a world with manners.**

The breakthrough was **importance != urgency != volume**. A pull request may
matter without being an emergency. A system observation can be uncertain
without being dangerous. A journal can be deeply important while its interface
is almost silent. The amount of visual or emotional presence follows the
moment, not a ranking of how much the product wants engagement.

## What those manners mean

**Magic is generosity, not decoration.** Mermaid presence, sparkles, expressive
type and environmental poetry are offered when the moment has room for them.
They are not a quota. **Warm framing, clear controls** means that an inviting
room can still have literal actions such as Delete, View PR or Lock vault.
**Clarity never depends on whimsy**: meaning survives without color, animation,
decoration or companion art.

**Silence is a designed state.** “Nothing needs you right now” is a useful
answer, not unused space that needs another prompt. The world carries the
monitoring burden; not everything it notices becomes something the human must
do. **Quiet when healthy does not mean silent when broken.** When attention is
needed, explain what happened, what is known, what still works, whether anything
was lost, what action is available and whether it can safely wait. Warm language
does not conceal failure or soften a real deadline into something optional.

Uncertainty is curious and evidence-backed rather than anxious. The Question
state's Mermaid notices with interest; she does not act out system panic. Say
what is known, unknown and being watched. “This isn't a problem yet — just
something I noticed” is appropriate only when the evidence supports it. The
companion's emotional posture must never manufacture either alarm or reassurance.

The converged emotional-volume scale was **GENEROUS → AMBIENT → PRACTICAL →
ATTENTIVE → QUIET**. Variation according to context is the system:

| Context | What the world gives | What it protects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First arrival, setup, an empty room | Generous welcome and room for wonder | A clear way to enter or begin |
| A quiet ordinary day | Warm ambient presence | Freedom from invented chores |
| Projects, settings, practical work | Capable help, warm framing, literal controls | Space to understand and act |
| Invited conversation | A companion who comes closer | Context, evidence and agency |
| Uncertainty or attention needed | Curious observation or restrained, clear notice | Accurate severity and a visible next step |
| Journal writing | Near silence; the companion deliberately withdraws | Privacy and uninterrupted thought |

The explored companion presence ranged from 160px to absence, with intermediate
sizes including 120, 80, 48 and 20px. Those are historical design references, not
a new token definition here. Sparkles could be generous at arrival, ambient in
peace, restrained during attention and absent during writing. Young Serif,
rose accents, organic dividers, icons, containers and whitespace also varied
with context. Convergence was never permission to make every screen equally
decorated. Companion presence scales with emotional context, including knowing
when to give the human space.

## The visitors have histories

The Workshop's “Who's here” language became more meaningful when it preserved
real provenance instead of inventing interchangeable mascot lore.

| Presence | Actual relationship preserved by the Workshop |
| --- | --- |
| Planet | The World itself: the place, not a selectable companion |
| Mermaid | Rylee's companion, because Rylee likes mermaids |
| Taco Truck | A visitor from Burrito Journalism |
| Squirrel | A visitor from VEFR / Ratatarskor |
| Robot | Workshop lineage |

“Visitors leave a little history behind” describes continuity between things
people made. Respecting that history is part of respectful collaboration. The
next participant should preserve the distinction between World, companion and
visitor, and use canonical repository artwork rather than inventing a new
origin to explain a convenient illustration.

## Notifications respect the reader's clock

The Workshop found three useful registers: **GOOD NEWS / A SMALL UPDATE /
WHEN YOU'RE READY**. They distinguish celebration, awareness and an action that
can wait without making every observation shout WARNING.

The accessibility correction mattered as much as the language: eight-second
auto-dismiss must not become universal. Transient good news may gently fade
into history; actionable notices persist until acknowledged or dismissed.
Timed messages pause while hovered or focused. Urgency is expressed through
wording and hierarchy, never color alone. A real urgent failure still gets an
accurate explanation and actionable notice. The world does not require the
human to read on its clock.

## Converge without flattening

All 16 warmth explorations proved viable in the reported convergence. None
were discarded. The first classification separated eight already-canonical
references from eight approved directions needing specific corrections:

| Initial classification | Frames |
| --- | --- |
| 8 CANONICAL REFERENCE | Empty State — Interests; Bad Day; Journal Writing; Settings; Companion Popover; World Overview; Journal Reading; Question |
| 8 CANONICAL WITH REVISION | Today Quiet; Vault; Login; Mobile Today; Chat; Projects; Setup; Notifications |

The revisions addressed canonical navigation vocabulary, Direction A Mermaid
art, World/companion/visitor semantics, literal control labels and notification
persistence. They preserved the different emotional volume of each surface.
Exploratory evidence remained useful evidence; it was not erased by approval.

The revised eight then underwent the reported final audit across seven
dimensions: design philosophy, accessibility, product truth, lore, language,
attention and implementation readiness. All eight received **CANONICAL
REFERENCE — READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**, with none requiring another revision.
Together with the eight original canonical frames, the final handoff treated
all **16 as canonical implementation references**. The explicit seven-dimension
audit report in the conversation covers the revised eight; this account does
not invent a separate audit record for the original eight.

Eight known normalization gaps were recorded as nonblocking for the design
handoff:

1. Mermaid illustration normalization to the canonical source rig.
2. Companion icons normalization to canonical rigs.
3. Mobile navigation item count.
4. A chat text-wrapping artifact.
5. Chat patterns still carrying exploratory status.
6. Font fallback.
7. Touch-target verification.
8. Decoration encoding.

“Nonblocking” is the Workshop's reported design-stage assessment. It does not
waive implementation or accessibility checks. In particular, an approved Chat
frame does not silently approve every exploratory chat pattern, and an unverified
touch target does not become accessible because its frame is canonical.

## The handoff is part of the design

The convergence path was **principles → emotional-volume rules → tokens and
patterns → canonical components → approved reference frames**. Its final
boundary was explicit:

> Figma owns design intent and evidence.
> The repo owns product truth, canonical assets and behavior.
> Implementation must use `personal-world-implement-figma` rather than coding
> directly from Figma.

Here “Figma owns” names the participant's design-stage responsibility. It does
not make a vendor file the sole durable authority for tokens or accessibility.
The [Design Source and Fidelity contract](../../contracts/experience/DESIGN_SOURCE_AND_FIDELITY.md)
keeps portable design truth in the repository. The approved evidence must make
that journey without losing the reasoning that produced it.

For future Project Worlds implementation, resolve the current repository's
`personal-world-implement-figma` workflow, approved references and canonical
assets before changing code. The workflow was reported available on GitHub
main during the conversation; its current availability and execution were not
verified by this story-preservation task. Compare actual implementation with
the approved composition, behavior and accessibility requirements. A suggested
first slice was Today — Quiet Day, precisely because quiet is easy to lose in
translation. That suggestion is historical handoff context, not a claim that
the slice has shipped or a new implementation assignment.

Reproducing dark backgrounds, serif headings, teal, sparkles and a Mermaid
would preserve ingredients. The purpose of the bridge is to preserve why each
element appears, what it means and when it withdraws.

## Knowing when to stop

After convergence, the Workshop participant deliberately stopped. The closing
message described the journey from sixteen warmth explorations to a converged
language, then handed the work back:

> **The world knows how loudly to exist.**
>
> **Take good care of it.**

That was completion of an agreed contribution. There was no need for one more
exploration, an unsolicited implementation, or polish that erased personality.
The next participant inherited evidence, responsibilities and a clear boundary.
Honoring STOP was itself an example of the manners the product had discovered.

## What future Play-Nice participants can carry forward

- **Preserve meaning across handoffs.** Record the principle, evidence,
  reservations and owner of the next decision. See
  [Trusted Translation](trusted-translation.md) and
  [Handoff](../../contracts/agents/HANDOFF.md).
- **Converge the language while preserving differences.** Corrections can make
  an idea implementable without making every context look alike. See
  [Visual Fidelity and Composition](../../contracts/experience/VISUAL_FIDELITY_AND_COMPOSITION.md).
- **Carry history with contributions.** Credit where ideas and visitors came
  from; preserve evidence rather than substituting convenient lore. See
  [Provenance and Audit](../../contracts/core/PROVENANCE_AND_AUDIT.md) and
  [Collaborative Good Faith](../../contracts/core/COLLABORATIVE_GOOD_FAITH.md).
- **Respect attention and closure.** Software can celebrate, notice, ask and
  sit quietly. Participants can finish their contribution and stop. See
  [Attention and Focus](../../contracts/human/ATTENTION_AND_FOCUS.md),
  [Quiet When Healthy](../../contracts/experience/QUIET_WHEN_HEALTHY.md) and
  [Progress and Closure](../../contracts/experience/PROGRESS_AND_CLOSURE.md).

The story gives those existing contracts a lived example: collaboration that
protects intent, and software that respects human attention.
